# Kalman-Filter-with-YOLOv5
This repository contains code for object tracking using Kalman filtering.

Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
The main tracking functionality can be found in the tracking.py file, which provides a KalmanTracker class that can be used to track objects in videos. Example usage can be found in the examples/example.ipynb file.
